# Rexpay III Service Optimization

This is an improved version of the Rexpay payment service with optimizations for higher authorization rates.

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced 3DS Handling**
   - Smart 3DS version detection
   - Fallback from 3DS2 to 3DS1 when needed
   - Enriched device information for better authentication

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Exponential backoff retry mechanism
   - Smart retry strategies based on error types
   - Detailed error logging and monitoring

3. **Data Validation**
   - Card data validation with Luhn algorithm
   - Address validation
   - Currency validation and fallback options

4. **Intelligent Routing**
   - Smart subaccount selection based on success rates
   - Load balancing with success rate weighting
   - Currency and amount-based routing

5. **Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Detailed transaction logging
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Success rate monitoring
   - Response time tracking

6. **Security Enhancements**
   - Improved card data encryption
   - Secure error handling
   - PCI-compliant data handling

## Authorization Rate Optimization Features

1. **Smart Retry Logic**
   - Automatically retries failed transactions with different strategies
   - Falls back to 3DS1 if 3DS2 fails
   - Attempts currency conversion for unsupported currencies

2. **Transaction Routing**
   - Routes transactions to subaccounts with highest success rates
   - Considers transaction amount and currency
   - Implements load balancing to prevent overloading

3. **Data Enrichment**
   - Provides rich device information
   - Includes detailed billing information
   - Supports multiple 3DS UI types

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Implements exponential backoff for retries
   - Handles network errors gracefully
   - Provides detailed error information for debugging

## Usage

```typescript
const rexpayService = new RexpayV3Service();
rexpayService.MID = 'your-merchant-id';
rexpayService.APIKEY = 'your-api-key';

// Initialize payment
const result = await rexpayService.initializePayment(payment, AUTHTYPE.THREE);
```

## Monitoring

The service includes comprehensive monitoring through the MetricsService:

- Transaction success rates
- Response times
- Error rates
- Authorization rates
- Processing times

## Error Handling

The service implements sophisticated error handling:

- Retries for transient errors
- Fallback strategies for permanent errors
- Detailed error logging
- Metric tracking for errors

## Configuration

Configure the service through environment variables:

```env
REXPAY_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
REXPAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
REXPAY_ENCRYPTION_IV=your-encryption-iv
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep retry attempts reasonable (default: 3)
2. Monitor metrics for optimization opportunities
3. Regularly review and update routing strategies
4. Keep device information up to date
5. Implement proper error handling in consuming code
